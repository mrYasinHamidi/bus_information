  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/animations/
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
